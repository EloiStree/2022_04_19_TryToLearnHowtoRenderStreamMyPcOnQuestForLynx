What I want is to be able to have my computer in the Lynx through streaming. To do a virtual desktop but that allows me to debug not to use my computer. 
And in best case scenario I want to be able to play in my lynx at 2D game on my computer but with 3D interaction in the lynx to move in the game.
(Only if streaming is possible at 20>fps)
